### ***Description***

Space Invaders is a stationary shooter game in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and shoots aliens at the top. The aliens start moving left and right as a group, moving downward (advancing the shooter) each time they reach the edge of the screen. The goal is to eliminate all aliens by shooting them. The game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen.
